# web_ui

Lightweight chat client that connects to the chat_gateway WebSocket and renders a fast-scrolling message list for `room:demo`.

## Running locally
Open `index.html` directly or serve the folder via any static server (nginx in Docker Compose by default). The UI expects the gateway at `ws://localhost:8080/ws`.
